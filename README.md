Digit Clustering Web Application

Overview
This project is a web-based application for clustering handwritten digit images using machine learning techniques. The application uses unsupervised learning to group similar digit images without prior labels.

Features
Upload handwritten digit images for clustering

Process images with advanced preprocessing techniques

Perform clustering using machine learning algorithms

Visualize clustered results
Interactive web UI powered by Flask
Usage
Upload a handwritten digit image.
The system preprocesses and clusters the digit.
View the clustering results and analysis.
Technologies Used
Python
Flask (Web Framework)
OpenCV (Image Preprocessing)
Scikit-learn (Clustering Algorithms)
NumPy, Pandas (Data Processing)
Deployment
To deploy online using GitHub and a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, Render):

Push the repository to GitHub.
Use a platform like Heroku or Render to deploy.
Ensure the required dependencies and Procfile are set up.
