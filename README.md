Digit Clustering using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates digit clustering using unsupervised learning techniques, primarily K-Means clustering, on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The goal is to group similar digit images together without using the labels (unsupervised approach).
